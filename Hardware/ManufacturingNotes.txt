For reference, an image of the latest existing hardware (v3.0) is attached. There are only a few changes to the layout between the current v3.1 and v3.0, mainly around USB5 as a polyfuse was added. P3 is also shown mounted in the v3 image, this is now a no-mount on v3.1. As the panel was laid out the wrong way for v3.0 (and the fact that I hand assembled the boards) the two parts of the board were separated before assembly - this has now been corrected for v3.1 (the board is NOT intended to be separated into two pieces before, during or after assembly).
